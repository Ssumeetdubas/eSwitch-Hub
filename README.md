# eSwitch-Hub

In this project basically we can control home appliencs using the application over the internet and also using the IR remote as offline mode 

This work basiclly using 2 microcontrollers 
1. Arduino Nano
2. Generic ESP8266

the communication used between both microcontroller is Serial Communcation 
here you need to uplode the arduino code in the NANO and connect all the relays to arudino with IR sensor
here the sole purpose of the ESP8266 is to conncet to internet and fetch the data form realtime database of google firebase.

NOTE: to execute the code as it is connect all the sensors and output devices to the pin numbers as given in code.
